## Rutherford Model of Atom – Simulation

This project is an interactive simulation of Ernest Rutherford’s alpha particle scattering experiment, which led to the discovery of the atomic nucleus.
It combines C++ computational modeling with a web-based visualization built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The simulation allows you to visualize how alpha particles scatter when they collide with gold atoms, showcasing the core principles of the Rutherford nuclear model of the atom.


## Features

Realistic Simulation Data – Generated using C++ and stored in CSV files (angles.csv, trajectories.csv).

Interactive Web Visualization – A browser-based interface to display the scattering process.

Educational Content – Explains the scientific significance of the experiment.

Customizable Parameters – Adjust particle counts, speeds, and visualization details.

Cross-Platform – Works in any modern browser.
